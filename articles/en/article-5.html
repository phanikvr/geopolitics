    <section class="article-body">
        <p>St. Martin's Island is the opening scene: its salience legally reinforced by the <strong>2012 ITLOS</strong>
            ruling and haunted by Cold War rumours from the <strong>1960s–1980s</strong>; a <strong>2018</strong>
            Myanmar map error briefly reignited anxieties. By <strong>2023</strong>, China's BRI moves in Myanmar and
            the commissioning of the <strong>BNS Sheikh Hasina submarine base near Cox's Bazar in 2023</strong>
            sharpened great‑power focus. When Myanmar's civil war began spilling over from <strong>February
                2024</strong>, St. Martin's value exploded. Prime Minister <strong>Sheikh Hasina</strong> alleged in
            <strong>2023–2024</strong> that foreign actors dangled "hassle free" elections for strategic access—claims
            Washington denied—turning maritime paranoia into combustible political fuel.
        </p>

        <p>Cut to <strong>2023</strong>: St. Martin's sits astride sea-lanes to the Strait of Malacca—roughly
            <strong>80%</strong> of China's energy imports transit there. Beijing is deepening ties (the <strong>BNS
                Sheikh Hasina</strong> base in <strong>2023</strong>; <strong>Kyaukpyu</strong> port under the BRI)
            transformed a regional flashpoint into a strategic problem. The United States then internationalised the
            issue, pitching the island as a potential surveillance, intelligence or military/air hub to monitor and
            counter China across the Bay of Bengal and the Indo‑Pacific.
        </p>

        <h2>The Quota Fault Line and the Legal Cascade</h2>

        <p>The proximate fault was bureaucratic: for decades <strong>30%</strong> of civil‑service posts were reserved
            for descendants of <strong>1971 "freedom fighters,"</strong> and layered quotas for women, districts,
            minorities and the disabled pushed total reservations past <strong>56%</strong>, targeting a vote bank and
            leaving under half of posts open to merit. The High Court's insistence that quota slots remain vacant
            created thousands of unusable posts. In <strong>2018</strong>, the government abolished quotas by executive
            circular, producing paralysis; ministries froze and courts probed. Smouldering campus anger exploded into
            mass mobilisation in <strong>June–July 2024</strong>. In a landmark <strong>December 2024</strong> High
            Court ruling, the Court struck down parts of the <strong>15th Amendment and restored the 13th
                Amendment's</strong> caretaker provisions, reviving the pre‑amendment mechanism for non‑partisan
            transition governments.</p>

        <p>Under the original caretaker law, the recently retired Chief Justice was the automatic first choice for Chief
            Adviser; if unavailable, the post passed to the next most senior retired judge. The 15th Amendment had
            removed that judicial priority, instead allowing any <strong>"qualified citizen"</strong> not affiliated
            with a political party to be appointed after consultations with major parties – a change that dramatically
            widened the shortlist and raised the political stakes.</p>

        <p>Student groups with NGOs influence, quickly rallied behind <strong>Muhammad Yunus</strong> as the citizen
            caretaker – a recommendation that ignited fierce debate and, as events unfolded, reshaped the transition.
        </p>

        <h2>Judicial Reversal, OSF Meetings and Rapid Reforms</h2>

        <p>After the caretaker revival, high profile meetings with foreign philanthropies and governance networks
            followed. An <strong>OSF</strong> delegation's discussions with interim leaders in <strong>2025</strong>—on
            economic rebuilding, asset tracing and combating misinformation—helped shape a rapid reform agenda.
            Presented as technical assistance, these interventions were domestically read as external influence shaping
            Dhaka's transition. Judicial reversals, OSF influenced reforms, and hurried policy changes created the
            perception that courts and foreign actors were jointly remaking Bangladesh's political order—fuel for those
            who argued the state had been hollowed out.</p>

        <h2>Student Clashes and the Mobilisation Machine</h2>

        <p>Student politics, long a proxy for national parties, ignited the streets. The Awami League's
            <strong>BCL</strong> clashed with <strong>JeI</strong> aligned student networks and emergent groups such as
            the <strong>National Citizen Party (NCP)</strong>. By <strong>late 2024</strong>, media and investigators
            reported coordinated funding: allegations that Islamist networks and foreign donors channelled money through
            <strong>NGOs</strong> and student fronts to sustain logistics, transport and digital campaigns. Whether
            fully proven or not, the pattern suggested mobilisation beyond spontaneous protest and exposed how opaque
            financing can weaponise youth anger.
        </p>

        <p>Two scandals crystallised grievance and fuel. <strong>Dr. Khalilur Rahman</strong>, the National Security
            Adviser, became a lightning rod: his long US residence, perceived foreign leanings, BNP accusations of
            handing over corridors and targeting rivals, alleged personal misconduct, and reports that he was barred
            from military installations intensified perceptions of civil military friction. And the unresolved legacy of
            the <strong>2004</strong> grenade attack—<strong>Tarique Rahman's</strong> exile to London in
            <strong>2008</strong> and the later quashing of convictions after <strong>5 August 2024</strong>—fed
            narratives of victimhood and vindication that opposition networks used to recruit and radicalise.
        </p>

        <h2>Foreign Interference and the Dangerous Opening</h2>

        <p>Pakistan re‑entered Dhaka's orbit: Foreign Minister <strong>Ishaq Dar's August 2025</strong> visit signalled
            renewed outreach; Dar rejected calls for a fresh apology and downplayed unresolved <strong>"1971
                Apology"</strong>. His softening toward <strong>JI</strong> reportedly signalled to figures like Rahman
            that full accountability wasn't required, helping explain JI's vague, tactical apology. Saudi and Libyan
            deals lit the fire, nudging Dhaka toward an <strong>"Islamic NATO"</strong> axis. After bans on JI‑linked
            outfits were eased, communal tensions flared and student‑party clashes intensified.</p>

        <h2>Asim Munir's Gambit: A military entrepreneur saw chaos as a ladder</h2>

        <p>Retired generals and security entrepreneurs saw Dhaka's wobble as a business plan. <strong>Asim
                Munir</strong>, billed as a bold strategist, treated institutional weakness like a ladder: Pakistan's
            diplomatic re‑entry was the launch, irredentist rhetoric—"Seven Sisters," Indian encirclement—was the
            marketing. The transaction was simple: stoke instability, then sell the cure—port access, corridor rights,
            training contracts—tied to a Pakistan‑anchored security architecture funded by Gulf cheques. Saudi and
            Libyan deals didn't just sweeten the pot; they lit the fire, pushing Dhaka toward an "Islamic NATO" pitch.
            Tactically, easing bans on JI‑led parties flooded the field with polarising actors so external pacts could
            be paraded as the only stabiliser.</p>

        <h2>When titans quarrel, the small suffer most</h2>

        <p>In the clash of titans (US and China), the western (US) giant wrenched a branch, unintentionally reducing the
            squirrel's (Bangladesh) home to dust. The lesson for smaller neighbours is clear: vulnerability is
            inevitable when living in the shadow of colliding giants.</p>

        <p>Stabilising Dhaka requires immediate, transparent caretaker implementation under Article 58C, rigorous
            oversight of political and NGO financing, and multilateral confidence building around maritime
            security—before St. Martin's becomes someone else's foothold.</p>
