        <p><strong>Imagine waking up to find your country cut off from the world's banks – no imports, no
                medicine, and no way to pay for fuel.</strong> That is the blunt reality when a nation loses
            access to SWIFT, the global "switchboard" for bank messages. For ordinary people the effect is
            immediate: factories stop-receiving parts, pharmacies cannot pay suppliers, and small exporters
            watch orders evaporate. What began as a technical fix has quietly become one of the most powerful
            levers in modern geopolitics.</p>

        <p>SWIFT (<strong>Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication</strong>) for Worldwide
            Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a banking network and messaging system created in the
            1970s to replace slow legacy channels and standardise cross‑border communication. Headquartered in
            Belgium and adopted by thousands of banks, it was built as neutral plumbing for global finance – a
            utility meant to connect the world. However, neutrality is fragile when politics enters the room,
            decisions about who stays connected are made in capitals, and those decisions can be weaponized.</p>

        <p>The turning point came in March 2012, when SWIFT announced it had been instructed to discontinue
            services to several Iranian banks – a step the organisation described as "extraordinary and
            unprecedented."</p>

        <p>The aim was to choke off oil revenues and pressure Tehran; the immediate effect was stalled
            transactions and real hardship for ordinary Iranians. That episode revealed a harsh truth: a system
            designed to make commerce easier can also be flipped into a lever of coercion.</p>

        <h2>A story that begins with the Shah and ends with Russia</h2>

        <p>To trace the roots , start with the fall of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – Iran's monarch – whose
            1979 overthrow toppled a US‑backed monarchy, brought clerical leaders to the centre of power and put
            oil production under state control. The revolution did more than change governments: it exported an
            ideology that alarmed Gulf monarchies and, together with a drive to nationalise resources, unsettled
            the regional balance. That overlap – revolutionary politics and economic nationalisation – created
            an opening regional rivals were quick to exploit. In 1980, Saddam Hussein launched a full‑scale
            invasion, hoping to capitalise on Iran's turmoil and settle territorial claims; the conflict
            hardened into a protracted, devastating war that reshaped Tehran's strategic calculus. In the
            aftermath, Iran pivoted away from direct conventional confrontation and leaned into deniable
            influence through proxy networks, while Gulf partners and Western allies framed those networks as
            insurgency and terrorism, amplifying the narrative in international media and diplomatic channels.
            Tehran has nationalised oil revenues, which underwrote state priorities, were portrayed by critics
            as funding proxy activity, turning routine sovereign income into a political liability. Over decades
            that narrative and the security concerns it fed evolved from targeted measures into broad financial
            pressure, culminating in the 2012 measures – including SWIFT restrictions – that sharply curtailed
            Iran's access to global markets and deepened the economic pain felt by ordinary citizens.</p>

        <h2>Crimea, MH17, and Ukraine's Westward pivot</h2>

        <p>The next major test of SWIFT's neutrality came in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea and the first
            wave of Western sanctions, Moscow realised how vulnerable its banks were to exclusion from SWIFT.
            Crimea's referendum and Russia's annexation triggered a sharp break with the West, intensified by
            the downing of MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people, The Buk TELAR missile launch by
            unknown sources – still disputed and deeply controversial – only intensified the mistrust already
            shaping the conflict.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Ukraine's Euromaidan revolution, the collapse of the Minsk agreements, anti‑oligarch
            reforms, and the political turbulence around Burisma pushed Kyiv decisively toward Western
            institutions. Burisma's U.S. political ties sparked a perception problem that critics argue blurred
            anti‑corruption efforts and slowed Ukraine's de‑oligarchization.</p>

        <p>Sanctions expanded across banking, defence and energy, Russia was suspended from the G8, and Western
            governments openly debated cutting Moscow off from SWIFT – a threat that would later shape the 2022
            sanctions package.</p>

        <p>Finally, the combination of Crimea, MH17 and Ukraine's Westward pivot had transformed SWIFT from
            neutral plumbing into a strategic pressure point capable of isolating a major economy.</p>

        <h2>Pressure, adaptation, counter‑systems</h2>

        <p>History shows a recurring pattern: <strong>pressure &#8594; adaptation &#8594;
                counter‑system</strong>. After threats of exclusion, states move quickly to build backups.
            Russia accelerated development of its domestic messaging system, SPFS, after 2014; China created
            CIPS (Cross‑Border Interbank Payment System) to clear RMB transactions and steadily expanded
            participation as Beijing sought to internationalize the yuan. BRICS leaders have publicly discussed
            BRICS Pay as part of a broader push to settle more trade in local currencies and reduce exposure to
            single‑network shutdowns. These projects are strategic insurance, not mere technical experiments.

        <h2>Why and how alternatives emerged</h2>

        <p>The drive to build SPFS, CIPS, and BRICS Pay was not curiosity but necessity.</p>

        <p><strong>Why</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Iran cut‑off showed that access to financial plumbing could be used as a sanctions tool.
            </li>
            <li>Heavy reliance on the US dollar exposes countries to sanctions and policy shocks.</li>
            <li>Many states view Western‑dominated institutions as biased, reinforcing the need for autonomy.
            </li>
            <li>States seek insurance against trade boycotts, ensuring their economies cannot be sidelined by
                the diplomatic failures of any single power.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>SPFS (Russia, 2014): Mirrors SWIFT formats; keeps domestic banks connected and allows limited
                foreign links.</li>
            <li>CIPS (China, 2015): Integrates RMB clearing and messaging; eases yuan‑denominated settlement.
            </li>
            <li>BRICS Pay (2023–24): Proposed digital platform for cross‑border settlement in local currencies.
            </li>
            <li>Currency swaps: Bilateral agreements (China–Argentina, India–Iran) enable direct currency
                exchange.</li>
            <li>Regional experiments: ASEAN and Latin American initiatives explore local currency settlement and
                digital units.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These systems are not yet as liquid or universal as SWIFT, but they represent a deliberate hedge
            against unilateral exclusion.</p>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <p>This is not an abstract contest among technocrats. When financial access is weaponized, hospitals,
            small businesses, exporters and state supply chains feel the pain first. Sanctions ripple outward to
            citizens, eroding trust in global financial governance. That erosion fuels political realignments
            and accelerates efforts to build alternatives that, over time, could fragment payments and raise
            costs for trade.</p>

        <p>Studies of UN voting and Global South cohesion document persistent North–South divides, reflecting
            mistrust of Western-dominated institutions. Economists note that monetary dominance brings both
            privilege and vulnerability; the networks underpinning global trade can be used as levers of
            statecraft.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>SWIFT began as a technical fix, yet it has evolved into a lever of power capable of isolating an
            entire nation from the global economy. Once financial plumbing becomes a battleground, pressure
            inevitably breeds alternatives.</p>
